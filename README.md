# About This Repo
This program has 3 games and a GUI for selecting one to play.
The games are:
- Hangman
- Connect 4
- Tic Tac Toe
It also has a settings menu for changing how progress in each game is saved.
There are 2 ways progress is saved:
- Temporarily (only while the program is running)
- Permanently (progress is saved in a file)
There is also an option to delete progress after exiting a game.

Note: The save files may not work when running the program outside of an IDE like Apache NetBeans.
